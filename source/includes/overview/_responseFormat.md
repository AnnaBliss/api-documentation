## Response Format

Responses can be returned in either **JSON** or **XML**.

*Applies to: Products API &#8226; Stores API &#8226; Categories API*

To request a single item, such as a specific product, indicate the desired response format with the extension added after the item's identifier. For example, `/products/8880044.json`.

To request a collection of items, such as all the products in our catalog, the desired response format is specified in the `format` query parameter. An example of this can be seen in the Retrieving Collections section. If no format is specified then xml will be returned.

*Applies to: Recommendations API*

When using any of the endpoints in the Recommendations API the response format returned will be json. The **XML** format is not supported for the Recommendations API endpoints. You can specify the format using `/6534009/alsoViewed.json` or not specify a format like `/6534009/alsoViewed`.
