# Buying Options (Open Box) API

The Buying Options API helps you access some of our best deals. This is where you'll find information about ship-from-store eligible Open Box products including availability, condition and special pricing, with more to come as we build out this API further. Our Open Box endpoints provide access to several categories of Best Buy merchandise, similar to the "Buying Options" tab on **BESTBUY.COM** product detail pages. We typically have multiple Open Box products for a single SKU. When a customer purchases an Open Box product on **BESTBUY.COM** we ship from the closest Best Buy store based on the customer shipping address. To assist in selecting the correct Open Box product we assign a condition of "excellent or certified" to the product in every Open Box offer.

+ "excellent" - products that look brand new in appearance, with no physical flaws, scratches or scuffs and include all original parts and accessories
+ "certified" - products that have passed the Geek Squad Certification process.

We have split Open Box into multiple endpoints:

+ The **Open Box Single SKU** endpoint lets you query for a specific product using the product identifier (SKU) for any available Open Box offers.
+ The **Open Box by list of SKUs** endpoint lets you query for a list of products using product identifier (SKU) for any available Open Box offers.
+ The **Open Box by Category** endpoint lets you query for a set of products based on their categories.

_All responses returned will be in a json format. In addition, we only return results for available product. We check for newly available product every five minutes.
